According to the City of Toronto, "Contaminated recycling is currently costing the City millions annually 
and last year an estimated 55,000 tonnes of non-recyclable material was incorrectly put in the Blue Bin."

TOP BLUE BIN OFFENDERS (from the City of Toronto website)

1. Food and organic waste 
"Food scraps like apple cores, eggshells or expired leftovers belong in your Green Bin. When you mistakenly 
toss food scraps in your Blue Bin, food residue and particles get soaked up by paper and can ruin large batches 
of otherwise good recyclables." 

2. Black plastics
"Black plastic of any kind, such as take-out containers and black garbage bags aren’t accepted in the City’s recycling program. 
There are two main reasons for this:
 - there is no stable market for the volume of black plastic generated in Toronto
 - black plastic cannot be sorted mechanically at the recycling facility because the optical sorting technology cannot recognize it."
